To better understand Refract, you only need a solid grasp of **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  
If youâ€™re comfortable with these basics, youâ€™re ready to dive in.  
:::

Learn how to integrate Refract into your project quickly and efficiently. With just a few steps, you can have a basic setup running and start building interactive UIs immediately.

## What is Refract?

Refract is a fictional JavaScript UI framework designed to simplify how you manage state, logic, and components in your applications. It builds on top of standard JavaScript concepts and introduces a refraction-based model for predictable state flow, composability, and reactivity.

Here is a minimal example:

```javascript
import { createApp, ref } from "vue";

createApp({
	setup() {
		return {
			count: ref(0),
		};
	},
}).mount("#app");
```

The above example demonstrates two of Refractâ€™s core ideas:

- Declarative Components: Instead of manually updating the DOM, you describe what the UI should look like, and Refract handles the updates.

- Refractions: A powerful state primitive that keeps track of values, automatically notifying components when they change.

You may already have questions â€” donâ€™t worry. Weâ€™ll cover every detail in the rest of this documentation. For now, just keep reading to get a high-level understanding of what Refract offers.

This documentation assumes basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If youâ€™re totally new to frontend development, it may help to brush up on those fundamentals first.

## The lightweight Library to build scalable UIs

Refract is more than just a way to build UIs itâ€™s designed to adapt to a wide range of use cases. Depending on your project, you can use Refract to:

- Add interactivity to static HTML pages without a build step

- Create reusable, composable components

- Build full single-page applications (SPAs)

- Manage complex state in large-scale apps

- Extend functionality with optics, effects, and derived state

The beauty of Refract is its incremental adoptability. You can start small and scale up as your needs grow. Whether youâ€™re experimenting with a tiny widget or building a production-ready app, the same core concepts will apply.

This is the unique feature of refract, it grows with you, adapts to your project, and makes state management clear, predictable, and scalable.
