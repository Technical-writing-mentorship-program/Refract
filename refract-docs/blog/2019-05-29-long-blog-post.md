## Release Cycle​

Refract does not have a fixed release cycle.Patch releases are released as needed.Minor releases always contain new features, with a typical time frame of 3~6 months in between. Minor releases always go through a beta pre-release phase.Major releases will be announced ahead of time, and will go through an early discussion phase and alpha / beta pre-release phases.Semantic Versioning Edge Cases​ Refract releases follow Semantic Versioning with a few edge cases.

## TypeScript Definitions​

We may ship incompatible changes to TypeScript definitions between minor versions. This is because:

- Sometimes TypeScript itself ships incompatible changes between minor versions, and we may have to adjust types to support newer versions of TypeScript.

- Occasionally we may need to adopt features that are only available in a newer version of TypeScript, raising the minimum required version of TypeScript.

- If you are using TypeScript, you can use a semver range that locks the current minor and manually upgrade when a new minor version of Vue is released.

## Compiled Code Compatibility with Older Runtime​

A newer minor version of Vue compiler may generate code that isn't compatible with the Vue runtime from an older minor version. For example, code generated by Vue 3.2 compiler may not be fully compatible if consumed by the runtime from Vue 3.1.

This is only a concern for library authors, because in applications, the compiler version and the runtime version is always the same. A version mismatch can only happen if you ship pre-compiled Vue component code as a package, and a consumer uses it in a project using an older version of Vue. As a result, your package may need to explicitly declare a minimum required minor version of Vue.

## Pre Releases​

- Minor releases typically go through a non-fixed number of beta releases. Major releases will go through an alpha phase and a beta phase.

- Additionally, we publish canary releases every week from the main and minor branches on GitHub. They are published as different packages to avoid bloating the npm metadata of the stable channel. You can install them via npx install-vue@canary or npx install-vue@canary-minor, respectively.

- Pre-releases are meant for integration / stability testing, and for early adopters to provide feedback for unstable features. Do not use pre-releases in production. All pre-releases are considered unstable and may ship breaking changes in between, so always pin to exact versions when using pre-releases.

## Deprecations​

We may periodically deprecate features that have new, better replacements in minor releases. Deprecated features will continue to work, and will be removed in the next major release after it entered deprecated status.
